### Hello, I am Dener 😁

I study Computer Engineering at UFES and at the moment I am studying Full Stack Development at Driven Education. I love new technologies 💻 and speculate on what the digital world will look like in the future 🔮. In my spare time I like to read 📖, go out with friends and watch movies 📽️ and TV series 📺.
